### Learning Outcomes: 
- Understand how commonly used data structures work, and the efficiency of their basic operations. 
- Understand ADTs and their relation to data structures. 
- Be able to write code using the C++ STL according to best practices. 
- Be able to analyze the complexity of algorithms and/or code. 
- Be able to design correct and efficient algorithms. 
- Be able to solve a programming problem efficiently by considering multiple approaches, selecting the most efficient solution, and implementing it using the C++ STL.

### Grading:
Your overall average will be the average of:
- Your weighted exam average
- Your weighted average on all homework and programming assignments.

In order to receive a passing grade, you must meet the overall average requirement (70% by Hunter policy but this may be lowered) and you must also get at least a 50% weighted exam average, and at least 50% total credit on your homework and programming assignments.

Constructive and regular class participation may raise your grade by up to one increment (e.g. B to B+)

#### Exams:
Two midterms and a final exam are planned. Your weighted exam average will be the greater of:
- The average of all 3 exams, or
- 60% of the final exam plus 40% of your higher midterm exam.

No make-up exams will be given, as it is not possible to ensure fair make-up exams in a class of this size and difficulty. If you miss an exam, you will simply default to the second grading option.

#### Programming Assignments: (4 - 5 projects)
- Programming assignments will be assigned on Blackboard and submitted on Gradescope.
The autograder will be used, however, it is to be used as a diagnostic tool, not a guarantee of program correctness. Hidden tests may be run, and graders may take away points given by the autograder if tests were passed using methods other than those specified.
- You are not permitted to share your code with other students. If you use GitHub or any other repository while you work on your projects, make sure all class projects are kept private until a month after the class ends.
- You are not permitted to post assignments from this course to any forum (Stack Overflow, Chegg, Course Hero, GeeksforGeeks, etc), or to otherwise solicit solutions to assignments.
- You are not permitted to use ChatGPT or any other generative AI to write code for you.
- You are not permitted to copy code from anywhere except the textbook, class notes and slides, resources listed on the class slides, and either of the C++ documentation sites we'll be using. You are not allowed to take code from tutorials, forums, or anywhere else. Doing so will be considered plagiarism, and will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct.
- Design, analysis, and implementation are the cornerstones of this course. If you don't try to design both the algorithm and code yourself before "researching" an answer, you will not learn what you will need in order to pass the exams.

#### Homework:
Homework assignments will be posted on Blackboard and submitted on Gradescope. Unlike programming assignments, homework assignments will generally be graded based on effort and completion, rather than correctness.
